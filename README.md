TUTORIALS USED

1:this is a tutorial which i used as a baseline for a couple things however i had to change almost all of it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9l1FcXmxv0&list=PLPuNhh82sRgk7S85quXb2_XI8b_jbmruB&index=2 fair warning tho some of the code seems to not work anymore so i had to improvise alot (rip 6 hours ) edit: actually rip about 14 ish hours
